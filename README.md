Whatever city you're in, if you get a hankering for live music, we've got what you need in one app.
Type in your city and hit the search button, and watch as the boundless evening street before you presents its musical offerings.
Each card displays the name of the band playing near you, a link to the venue so you can check out its vibe, and the price range of tickets with a link to purchase them.
A youTube video also loads in each event's card, so you can see whether or not you like a band you haven't heard of, and start getting into the jams of the band you picked!
On this project we learned how to collaborate, use multiple APIs at the same time, and deepened our skill in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
